<p><b>Previously, I had built a home-made blog with ASP.NET Core</b>, hosted it on a CentOS VM, and had some fun configuring it to make it work.
Soon after, I realized that paying the hosting fees, although small, didn't make sense for a simple, almost static website.
So, I heard about GitHub Pages, and tried to setup the Jenkins-Ruby thing and spin it online!</p>
<p>But... <b>Lots of things to install (Ruby, Bundler, Gems, ...) which I've never used</b>. Spent my sunday morning trying to set it up on my old Macbook Air, but somehow it kept going into confusion with Ruby's versions, and although I searched a bit online, I couldn't make it work. I'm not saying the issue is with Ruby, Jenkins or anything related. It's probably my fault, I use my Macbook very few times, probably got something wrong with the PATH system. But... it's just... too many things to install, configure, adapt, with so much that could go wrong, and all this effort just to make a simple, static website?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p><b>I searched a bit for alternatives, and found this nice little repositories called <a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite" target="__blank">makesite.py</a></b>. It's a relatively simple script in Python to create your own static website maker. I don't know much about Python, but didn't have many issues configuring it to adapt to my needs.</p>
<p>So, here we are, with our brand-new website! So cool... modern... those graphics, <b>wow</b>... Yeah, I'm practically lost without a designer by my side. I'll ask my fianc√© for help...</p>
