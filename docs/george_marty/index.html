<p>George, just like Marty, is a lady nanday conure.</p>
<p>I raised her since she was a very <i>"smoll birb"</i>, as parrots memes say. It was 2002, and I wasn't even attending high school yet.</p>
<p>Now she's a grumpy (granny?) 18-years old conure lady. She absolutely loves scritches, sleeping, and eating her (very expensive) pellets.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Marty</h2>
<div style="margin-top: 15px;" align="center"><img class="home" height="500" width="375" src="../images/marty_01.jpg"/></div>
<p>Marty too is a lady nanday conure!</p>
<p>Marty is a very recent addition to our small flock. She lived most of her life, since her hatchday (February 2008), in a very unhealthy and dangerous environment, with a cat constantly trying to eat her.</p>
<p>Fortunately for her, the previous owner decided to get rid of her, and since we were looking for a mate for George, I happily took Marty in our home.</p>
<p>She has three fractured bones, preventing her from flying and walking correctly, a severe feather-plucking issue, and her temperament is unpredictable sometimes. But with meds, patience and perseverance, she's doing better every day.</p>
