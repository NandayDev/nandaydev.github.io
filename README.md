## Nanday.dev website

This is my personal website public repository (thanks to GitHub Pages). The website is written in Flutter/Dart, and published via the `flutter build web` command.

Website's starting template is by [David Cobbina](https://davidcobbina.com/home) and modified by me to suit my need (I suck at designing!).
