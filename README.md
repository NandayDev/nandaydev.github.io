## Nanday.dev website

This is my personal website public repository. I'm using GitHub Pages as host. The website is written in Flutter/Dart, and published via the `flutter build web` command.

Website's starting template is by [David Cobbina](https://davidcobbina.com/home) and modified by me to suits my need (I suck at designing!).
